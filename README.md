# Project-8---Data-Processing-Machine-Learning-

Complete this project by predicting housing prices in Califronia for more than 26 districts. through data processing and Machine Learning. 



MEthod for completion:

1) Data import and inspect
2) Data Cleaning 
3) Use Seaborn to represent data 
4) Implement machine learning 

Dict:

* **longitude:**  geographic coordinate (district´s east-west position)
* **latitude:**  geographic coordinate (district´s north-south position)
* **housing_median_age:** median age of houses in district
* **total_rooms** Sum of all rooms in district
* **total_bedrooms** Sum of all bedrooms in district
* **population:** total population in district
* **households:** total households in district
* **median_income:** median household income in district 
* **median_house_value:** median house value in district
* **ocean_proximity:** District´s proximity to the ocean



Key points gathered from data:

Mean aggregate key points to acknowledge
- The average household is 3.07
- Average rooms are 5.43
- 0.21 bedrooms per room

Positive correlations between the following:
- Higher the income / higher the housing value
- Rooms per household/house prices (larger the house higher the price)
- Median housing age / larger districts

Weak or no correlation(no linear) between the following:
- house price and household
- population / longitude

Negative correlation
- bedrooms per room (more non-bedrooms per household)
